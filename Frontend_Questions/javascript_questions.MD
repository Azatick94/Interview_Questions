<h2>Common HTML Events</h2>
Here is a list of some common HTML events:
* onchange	- An HTML element has been changed 
* onclick -	The user clicks an HTML element 
* onmouseover -	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
* onmouseout -	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
* onkeydown -	The user pushes a keyboard key
* onload -	The browser has finished loading the page

<h2>* What is Ajax?</h2>
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.
AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
